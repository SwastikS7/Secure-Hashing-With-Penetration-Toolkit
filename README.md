This project focuses on securing e-commerce transactions by preventing website tampering through advanced attack protection mechanisms. Key features include:

Dynamic Attack Protection: Implements a toggleable security layer to detect and block tampering attempts during payment transactions.
Data Integrity Validation: Utilizes SHA-512 hashing to secure critical fields like product prices, ensuring they cannot be altered during requests.
Coupon Management: Introduces a secure coupon application module integrated with Stripe, allowing dynamic discounts while maintaining data integrity.
Penetration Testing: Simulates real-world attacks using Burp Suite to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
This project demonstrates a robust methodology for enhancing web application security against common cyber threats.
